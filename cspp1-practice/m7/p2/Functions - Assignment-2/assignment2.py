"""# Assignment-2 - Paying Debt off in a Year

# Now write a program that calculates the minimum fixed monthly payment needed
#in order pay off a credit card balance within 12 months.
# By a fixed monthly payment, we mean a single number which does not change each month,but instead
# is a constant amount that will be
# paid each month
# In this problem, we will not be dealing with a minimum monthly payment rate.
# The following variables contain values as described below:
# balance - the outstanding balance on the credit card
# annualInterestRate - annual interest rate as a decimal
# The program should print out one line: the lowest monthly payment that will
# pay off all debt in under 1 year, for example:
# Lowest Payment: 180"""

    #at the end of the month (after the payment for that month is made).
    #The monthly payment must be a multiple of $10 and is the same for all months. Notice that it is
    # possible for the balance to become
    # negative using this payment scheme, which is okay.
    # A summary of the required math is found below:
    # Monthly interest rate = (Annual interest rate) / 12.0
